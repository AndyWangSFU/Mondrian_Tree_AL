Other experiments and things I tried and looked at. Some examples are:

Simulations when the data is piecewise linear
Using more than 2 stages during the active learning
Using the active learning algorithm, but with a Breiman Tree instead 
Mondrian Tree.
Beginning with equal amount of data in each leaf, rather than randomly
sampling to start with.
Looking at the variance of the mean estimate (conditioned on the variance
of the sample being higher or lower than the population variance) for 
univariate distributions. 

These scripts may have bugs, are not well commented, and will not run
from their current location.
