After submission a small but was discovered by Yeqing Lin, where the naive uncertainty sampling 
experiments were not correctly using the global variance in leaves with no data in stage 1, 
instead using variance of 0 and ensuring these leaves did not get any samples during stage 2. 
This bug did not result in qualitative differences (the theoretically justified proportions
still performed better) but the naive uncertainty sampling scheme is slightly better than it 
appears in the paper.
